Scripts to make life easier for everyone

These scripts have been set up to work with raycast , just add them to you folder that have ray cast scripts , reload scripts from raycast , and than add your hot keys for each. 
Setting up raycast with scripts and hot keys:

If your not used to setting up raycast scripts and short cut keys, I will do quick walkthrough.

You don’t have to add chmod permissions to the scripts when working with raycast.

Pop the scripts in the folder analyst-raycast-configuration/scripts/utilities 

Open raycast and reload scripts 

Than go to extensions to set hot keys 

Now create your hot key

Now just copy your link , in this instance for a url that has a attached email in plain text or base64 and hit your hot key 

For proofpoint/safelinks , copy link and hit your hot key , decoded link will populate in clipboard
For File hash script, copy filename after downloading and hash will populate in clipboard
For random Microsoft email creator , just hit hot key and the email address will populate in clipboard
For Quick email add, copy the link with embedded email (b64 encoded or plain string) and hit hotkey and new link will populate in clipboard

I found this helpful but if you can improve please do, just trying to make everyone’s life a lil easier .
